      <h1>Getting Lost in a Familiar Place</h1>
      <h3>Reclaiming our public space</h3>
    </header>

    </br>

    <p>The streets can be a liminal space. A place between other places. You go on them to get somewhere else - home, work, or a store. Usually we are only present on them in between spaces where we get or spend money.</p>

    <p>Enter a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dérive">Dérive</a>. Take an unplanned journey through the urban landscape. Treat the street as it's own destination. Go on an walk, without needing a place to get to. Let yourself drift and follow your feelings.</p>

    <h3>Techniques</h3>
    <p>Go on a walk following one or several of these rules. Treat the street as it's own location which can, and should be, explored.</p>
    <ul>

      <li>Follow a red vehicle.</li>
      <li>Step on cracks in the pavement.</li>
      <li>Pick a color. Go towards it.</li>
      <li>Pick a building in the distance. Go towards it.</li>
      <li>Go east for three blocks.</li>
      <li>Flip a coin. Heads means turn left, tails means turn right.</li>
      <li>Walk without a direction.</li>
      <li>Look for rhyming signs.</li>
      <li>Turn left or right. It's a free world.</li>
      <li>Turn whenever you reach a red light.</li>
      <li>When a street name starts with a vowel turn left.</li>
      <li>Find an interesting tree.</li>
      <li>Look at the chimneys.</li>
      <li>Find a fancy car. Go in the direction it's wheels are pointing.</li>
      <li>Find shade. Observe it.</li>
      <li>Find a place to sit for five minutes. Watch.</li>
      <li>At the next opportunity turn right.</li>
      <li>Stop and listen. Follow that sound.</li>
      <li>Pick any direction and go straight for five blocks.</li>
      <li>Go towards laughter. </li>
      <li>Turn left at the next corner.</li>
      <li>Wave and smile at the next surveillance camera.</li>
      <li>Head in the noisiest direction.</li>
      <li>What is this area know for? Find the opposite.</li>

    </ul>
