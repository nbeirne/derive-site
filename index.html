      <h1>Getting Lost in a Familiar Place</h1>
      <h3>Going on a walk can be a form of resistance. The streets are here for us to use and enjoy.</h3>

    <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dérive">Dérive</a></h2>
    <p>The streets can be a liminal space. A place between other places. You go on them to get somewhere else - home, work, or a store. Usually we are only present on them in between spaces where we get or spend money.</p>

    <p>Enter a Dérive. Treat the street as it's own destination. Go on an walk, without needing a place to get to. Let yourself drift and follow your feelings.</p>

    <p>Here is a list of techniques to follow. Try following one or a few of these rules for an entire walk.</p>
